## Bomberman
Bomberman is a classic action-maze game originally released for the NES in 1985. Players control a robot named Bomberman who must navigate grid-based levels, placing bombs to destroy obstacles and defeat enemies. The goal is to clear each stage by eliminating all enemies and finding the hidden exit. With its simple yet addictive gameplay, Bomberman laid the foundation for a beloved franchise known for its strategic bomb-dropping mechanics and multiplayer fun.

## How to Play Bomberman
### Objective:
Clear each maze-like stage by defeating all enemies using bombs, then find the hidden exit under a destructible block.
* Move Bomberman through the grid-based maze.
* Drop bombs to destroy soft blocks and defeat enemies.
* Avoid getting caught in your own bomb blasts or touching enemies.
* Once all enemies are defeated, find the exit (hidden under a soft block) to move to the next level.
* Collect power-ups hidden in blocks to increase your abilities.

Use the arrow keys to move Bomberman up, down, left, and right. 
Press space to place a bomb. The [] key is used to start or pause the game.
